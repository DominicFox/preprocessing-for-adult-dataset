# preprocessing-for-adult-dataset

This is the code that accompanies my blog post available here: https://domjfox.com/preprocessing-for-the-adult-dataset/ 

The focus of this code is covering my first time trying to apply preprocessing to a dataset. The main concepts are imputing, ordinal encoding, one-hot encoding and value scaling.
